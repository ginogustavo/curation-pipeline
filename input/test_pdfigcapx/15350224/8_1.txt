Figure 4. Arg378 of Smad4 Reinforces Phosphoserine Binding in the AB Interface(A) Surface electrostatic potential presentation of the L3 loop/â¤8 strand pocket for Smad4 (left) and Smad2 (right). The R-Smad C-terminalphosphoserine structures are shown in stick presentation.(B) The stereoview of the 2Fo Ïª Fc simulated annealed omit electron density map of the Arg378 region of S4AF.(C) Size exclusion chromatography analysis of interaction between the wild-type S4AF or S4AF(R378A) mutant with S3LC(2P) or S2LC(2P).S4AF or S4AF(R378A) mutant was mixed equal molar ratio to the S3LC(2P) or S2LC(2P), and the mixture was loaded to the size exclusioncolumn. The eluted fractions were run on a denaturing gel and stained with Coomassie blue. The excess, uncomplexed S4AF or S4AF(R378A)eluted as a monomer with the peak around fraction 22. Interaction between the wild-type S4AF with S2LC(2P) or S3LC(2P) is indicated bytheir coelution as a heteromeric complex with the peak position around fraction 15. The decreased interaction in the case of the S4AF(R378A)mutant is indicated by the lower staining of the S4AF(R378A) band in the complex fractions as compared to the wild-type S4AF.(D) ITC analysis of the interaction between S4AF(R378A) and S3LC(2P). The S4AF(R378A) data are in open circles. The wild-type S4AF dataare in filled squares for comparison.
