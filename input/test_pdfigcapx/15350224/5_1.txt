Figure 2. Structural Comparison between the R-Smad/Smad4 Heterotrimer and R-Smad Homotrimer(A) Left, superposition of the â£ carbon traces of the Smad3/Smad4 heterotrimer and the Smad2 homotrimer. The homotrimeric structure ofSmad2 is in gray. The Smad3 and Smad4 subunits of the heterotrimer are in green and cyan, respectively. The boxed region shows the majorconformational difference, involving helix H3 and H4, between the two structures. Right, close-up view of the helix H3/H4 region of Smad4and the corresponding region in Smad2 is shown. Helices H5, which are in similar position in both structures, are removed in the close-upview for clarity.(B) Comparison of hydrogen bonding interactions between the R-Smad/Smad4 heterotrimeric interfaces (AB, BC, and CA interfaces) and theSmad2 homotrimeric interface. The three helix bundle regions and the phosphorylated C-terminal tails are in red. The loop-helix regions andthe L3 loop/â¤8 pockets are in blue. The unique features in the BC and AB interfaces, which are likely the key contributors to the preferentialformation of the heterotrimer, are circled.
