Figure 3. Asp493 of Smad4 Coordinates a Buried Electrostatic Interaction in the BC Interface(A) Close-up view of the helix 4-helix 1 interaction in the Smad2 homotrimer (left) and the BC interface of the Smad3/Smad4 heterotrimer(right). The presence of aspartic acid at position 493 of Smad4 (as opposed to Tyr406 of Smad2), coupled with the shift in helix H4, resultsin highly favorable electrostatic interactions between Asp493 and four surrounding arginine residues. This results in improved interfacecontacts over those in the Smad2 homotrimeric interface.(B) The stereoview of the 2Fo Ïª Fc simulated annealed omit map of the Asp493 region of S4AF.(C) Size exclusion chromatography analysis of interaction between the wild-type S4AF or S4AF(D493A) mutant with S3LC(2P) or S2LC(2P).S4AF or S4AF(D493A) mutant was mixed equal molar ratio to the S3LC(2P) or S2LC(2P), and the mixture was loaded to the size exclusioncolumn. The eluted fractions were run on a denaturing gel and stained with Coomassie blue. The excess, uncomplexed S4AF or S4AF(D493A)eluted as a monomer with the peak around fraction 22. Interaction between the wild-type S4AF with S2LC(2P) or S3LC(2P) is indicated bytheir coelution as a heteromeric complex with the peak position around fraction 15. The lack of an interaction in the case of the S4AF(D493A)mutant is indicated by the near absence of the S4AF(D493A) band in the complex fractions.(D) ITC analysis of the interaction between S4AF(D493A) and S3LC(2P). The S4AF(D493A) data are in open circles. The wild-type S4AF dataare in filled squares for comparison.(E) Coimmunoprecipitation analysis of Smad2/Smad4 and Smad3/Smad4 interaction. COS-1 cells were transfected with FLAG-tagged full-length Smad2 or Smad3 with or without Myc-tagged Smad4 or Smad4(D493A), and with or without the constitutively active TGF-â¤ type Ireceptor (Wieser et al., 1995). Complexes were immunoprecipitated from cell extracts with an anti-FLAG antibody and immunoblotted witheither anti-FLAG or anti-Myc antibody as indicated.
