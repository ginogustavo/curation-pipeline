Figure 1. Stoichiometry of the R-Smad/Smad4 Complex(A) Crystal structures of the Smad2/Smad4(left) and Smad3/Smad4 (right) complexes.The Smad2 subunits are in red. The Smad3subunits are in green. The Smad4 subunits inboth complexes are in cyan. The L3 loops arein yellow. The phosphoserine side chains arein stick presentation.(B) ITC analysis of the interaction betweenSmad2 and Smad4 (left), and Smad3 andSmad4 (right). The thermodynamic parame-ters derived from the fitting are shown in Ta-ble 2.
